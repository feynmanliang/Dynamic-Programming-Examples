# Dynamic Programming Examples
Feynman Liang, 4-7-2012

These files demonstrate different applications of dynamic
programming. In most examples, memoization is used to trade space
efficiency for time efficiency, oftentimes reducing algorithms from
exponential to polynomial run times.

15.4-5 - Find maximum monotonically increasing sub sequence using
depth first search, reconstruct and print solution

15-4 - Formats line wrapping by calculating optimal insertions of line
breaks such that the cube of the amount of extra white space in the
document is minimized.

15-8 - Calculates a minimally disruptive seam in an image by a
breadth-first search for the shortest path given a costMatrix.

These examples were taken from "Introduction to Algorithms" (ISBN 0262033844)
